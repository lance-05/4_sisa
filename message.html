        <p>Happy 1 year and 5 months, love. I want to start by thanking you for staying by my side and for always understanding me, even when I’m at my worst. You’ve chosen me time and time again. I truly appreciate everything you do for us and our relationship.</p>
        <p>I also want to take this moment to apologize for the times I’ve hurt you, especially in the beginning. I know there were moments when I failed to be the partner you deserve, and I’m deeply sorry for that. I never meant to hurt your feelings, and I promise to keep learning, growing, and be better everyday. </p>
        <p>Looking ahead, I hope we continue to grow together, learning to communicate more openly and to truly hear each other. I want us to face every challenge with strength, patience, and understanding. I know we can make it through anything as long as we stay strong together. Thank you for being my heart’s home. I love you more than words can say.</p>
